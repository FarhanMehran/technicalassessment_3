 Code Overview

 ViewController

The `ViewController` class is responsible for managing the user interface and user interactions. It includes:

-setupNavigationBar(): Configures the navigation bar with "Add Text" and "Save" buttons.
-setupImageView(): Initializes the canvas image view and sets its properties.
-addText(): Adds a text view to the canvas image.
-setupTextField(): Configures the text view and adds gesture recognizers.
-addGestures(view:): Adds pan, pinch, and rotation gestures to the text view.
-saveImage(): Captures the current state of the canvas and saves it as an image.
-setupColourSlider(): Initializes the color slider for selecting text color.

 Gesture Handling

The following methods handle user gestures on the text view:

-panGesture(_:): Moves the text view based on drag gestures.
-pinchGesture(_:): Scales the text view based on pinch gestures.
-rotationGesture(_:): Rotates the text view based on rotation gestures.

 Color Selection

The `RSColourSlider` allows users to select a color for the text. The selected color is updated in the text view.
